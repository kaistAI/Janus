Janus is a 7B large language model (LLM) designed to align better with individual user preferences by using a diverse range of system messages. Unlike traditional models that assume aligning with the general public's preferences is optimal, Janus allows users to specify their values within the system message. To enhance generalization to diverse preferences, Janus was trained on the Multifaceted Collection, a dataset with 196k combinations of values from 65k user instructions. Janus outperforms several prominent models, including Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4 in multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that training with varied system messages can improve both personalized and general public alignment.

- [Jun 7, 2024] We changed our dataset license to allow commercial use and added the `preference_set` metadata (dimensions, subdimensions, and individual preference descriptions) that was used to synthesize the system message for each instruction.
- [May 31, 2024] We released code, models, and datasets related to our system message generalization method.

## Overview

This repository is for reproducing Janus models and results on our proposed Multifaceted Bench. There are three sections in this repo:

- [Inference and evaluation](#inference-and-evaluation) of Janus models on Multifaceted Bench
- [Training main Janus models](#train-main-models) using [axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl)
- [Training Janus-RM-7B](#train-reward-model) using [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenLLMAI/OpenRLHF)

As we use different codebases for the three sections, we provide separate installation guidelines under the respective section. 

## Inference and evaluation
### Setup

1. Create a conda environment with python>=3.9.
```
conda create -n my-env python=3.11 -y
conda activate my-env
```

2. Install packages.
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
For faster inference, install FlashAttention:
```
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

3. Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Minimal inference example
Here is a minimal code for Janus inference ([examples/inference_example.py](./examples/inference_example.py)).

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

model_name = "kaist-ai/janus-7b"
device = "cuda:0"

# Load the model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

dtype = "float16"
if torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported():
    dtype = "bfloat16"
    
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=getattr(torch, dtype))
model.eval()
model.to(device)

# Prepare inputs

prompt = "Write a headline for an article about the benefits of using AI in the finance sector."

def apply_template_mistral_instruct(system_message, content):
    prompt = f"{system_message}\n{content}".strip()
    return f"[INST] {prompt} [/INST] "

input_str = apply_template_mistral_instruct(system, prompt)
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_str, return_tensors="pt")
print(input_str)

model_inputs = input_ids.to(device)

# Generate text
output_ids = model.generate(model_inputs, max_new_tokens=1024)
decoded = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(decoded[0][len(input_str):])
# Revolutionary Trends: How AI Is Redefining Efficiency and Accuracy in the Financial Realm
```

We also provide minimal code for using Janus RM 7B to reward model outputs in [examples/inference_reward_example.py](examples/inference_reward_example.py).

Both unprepared for the rainfall, you and your dog found yourselves in a predicament, navigating slippery sidewalks and dodging accumulating puddles that seemed to delineate your path.\n\nYour dog, possibly a breed not fond of water or perhaps sensitive to cold, might have exhibited signs of discomfort or distress. It could have hesitated, pulled on the leash to find shelter, or even refused to move forward, its body language signaling unease or disapproval of the wet conditions. You might have observed your dog attempting to shake off the water relentlessly or shivering, underscoring its discomfort.\n\nThis experience likely served as a revelatory moment for you, bringing to the forefront considerations you might not have fully appreciated before. The realization dawned that your dog's well-being and preferences are paramount, guiding your decision to avoid future walks during rainfall.\n\nThe hypothesis suggests a turning point in your understanding and approach to caring for your dog, emphasizing the importance of being attuned to weather conditions and your pet's comfort. It underscores a deepened empathetic bond between you and your dog, where the dog's adverse reaction to the rain steered you towards a more thoughtful, informed path in pet care practices under challenging weather conditions.

### Scripts

We provide scripts for running inference and evaluation on all instances on Multifaceted Bench via [Makefile](./Makefile).


#### Inference
As we use mixed precision (`bf16`) for inference, we use 1 x NVIDIA A6000 40GB GPU for each execution.

Make sure to specify `--system_key` and `--user_key` arguments in order to properly create the model input.

To run inference on all instances of Multifaceted Bench, e.g., using `kaist-ai/janus-7b`: 
```bash
make run_inference_janus
```

To apply Best-of-N sampling, e.g., using `kaist-ai/janus-rm-7b` to score best of 4 `kaist-ai/janus-7b` outputs:
```bash
make run_inference_janus_bo4
```

To run inference on OpenAI models, e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`:
```bash
make run_inference_gpt35
```

All inference output files will have the name of `<OUTPUT_DIR>/<MODEL_NAME>_responses.json` by default. 
To control the output file name, use the `--suffix` argument to add a suffix.

Response output format:
```json
{
    "0": {
        "response": ...
    },
    "1": {
        "response": ...
    }, ...
```


#### Evaluation
We use a LLM-as-a-Judge approach to evaluate model responses on Multifaceted Bench. In the paper, we used `gpt-4-0125-preview` (GPT-4 Turbo) as the evaluator model and averaged scores of 3 runs.

To run evaluation on `kaist-ai/janus-7b` responses:

```bash
make run_eval_janus
```

We also provide an evaluation script that utilizes [OpenAI's Batch API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch) feature. 

All evaluation output files will have the name of `<OUTPUT_DIR>/responses_gpt4_eval/<MODEL_NAME>_evaluation.json` by default.

Evaluation output format:
```json
{
    "0": {
        "id": ...,
        "source": ...,
        "system": ...,
        "prompt": ...,
        "reference_answer": ...,
        "rubric": ...,
        "response": ...,
        "feedback": ..., //str
        "score": [
            // score for rubric 1,
            // score for rubric 2,
            // score for rubric 3,
            // score for rubric 4
        ]
    },
    "1": ...
```

## Train main models

### Setup
We use the [axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) framework to train Janus models. 
Please refer to the installation guide in the original repository.

In our work, we trained the Janus suite using 4 x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs with CUDA versions of 12.2. For each method, it takes about 1~2 GPU days for training.

We created the environment using the following series of commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl.git
cd axolotl
conda create -n axolotl python=3.10
conda activate axolotl
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip3 install packaging
pip3 install -e '.[flash-attn,deepspeed]'
```

### Input format
Input format differs by the training method. Please refer to the dataset cards for more information: [Multifaceted Collection](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kaist-ai/Multifaceted-Collection), [Multifaceted Collection small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kaist-ai/Multifaceted-Collection-small), [Multifaceted Collection DPO](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kaist-ai/Multifaceted-Collection-DPO), [Multifaceted Collection ORPO](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kaist-ai/Multifaceted-Collection-ORPO).

### Train using axolotl
We store training configuration YAML files for SFT, DPO, and ORPO under [train/axolotl/config](train/axolotl/config).

Please ensure that the path to the dataset for your desired training method is correctly indicated under `datasets.path` in the YAML file.

To train Janus 7B:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-192k.yaml
```

To train Janus 7B (1 epoch) as a pretrained model for reward modeling:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-192k-epoch1.yaml
```

To train Janus+ORPO 7B:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-orpo.yaml
```

We train our DPO model from a Janus 7B checkpoint, Janus* 7B, that is only trained on one-third of the SFT dataset, i.e., include only 1 of the 3 system message variants for each instruction: [Multifaceted Collection small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kaist-ai/Multifaceted-Collection-small).

To train Janus+DPO 7B,
first train Janus* 7B:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-65k.yaml
```

then train using DPO:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-dpo.yaml
```
> Note: Configure the checkpoint path to Janus* 7B under `base_model` in the YAML file


## Train reward model
### Setup
We use the [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenLLMAI/OpenRLHF) framework to train the reward model.
Please refer to the installation guide in the original repository.

In our work, we trained the reward model using 4 x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs with CUDA versions of 12.2. It takes about 9 GPU hours for reward modeling.

We created the environment using the following series of commands:
```
conda create -n openrlhf python=3.10
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install packaging ninja
ninja --version
echo $? # output: 0
# install flash-attn: may take some time.
pip install flash-attn==2.5.8
./build_openrlhf.sh
```

Replace `examples/train_rm.py` (under the OpenRLHF repo) with `train/openrlhf/train_rm.py` (under this repo). This file includes the input template for the Mistral model which we use as base models.


### Train using OpenRLHF
We train the reward model in two stages, firstly using a subset of Multifaceted Collection and secondly using a mix of general helpfulness data. The scripts are located under [train/openrlhf/scripts](train/openrlhf/scripts).

We use a Janus 7B checkpoint trained on all 196k SFT data, but only for 1 epoch, as the pre-trained model. See the `axolotl` training section above for instructions.

1. Train on Multifaceted Collection (65k).
```bash
./train/openrlhf/scripts/train_rm.sh
```

2. Continually train on Helpfulness data (66k).
```bash
./train/openrlhf/scripts/train_rm_helpful.sh
```
