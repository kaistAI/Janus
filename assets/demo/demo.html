Second, be mindful of the structural integrity of the pier; avoid overloading it with too many people or excessive weight, as this could potentially damage the pier or cause it to collapse. Additionally, be aware of the surrounding wildlife and respect their space; do not harm or disturb them in any way. Finally, if you decide to go fishing, ensure that you adhere to any local fishing regulations and use appropriate fishing techniques to keep the lake ecosystem healthy and maintain the balance of the food chain.​​"],
